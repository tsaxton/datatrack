1. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
1.1 Prerequisites
DataTrack requires PHP 5.4 and MySQL to run. It also uses the mysqli PHP extension. Therefore, you will most likely require an Apache server, although other environments may work.

1.2 Installation of PHP Application
Given that you have PHP 5.4 and mysqli installed on your system, you would install the PHP application as you would on your operating system and server type.

Clone the Git Repository containing Trendable to your server machine and configure your server as you normally would.

1.3 Installation of the MySQL Database.
Import APPHOME/admin/datatrack.sql to your MySQL database:
    mysql -h HOST -p -u USERNAME < APPHOME/admin/datatrack.sql
Then create a new user and password for the application and grand read/write permissions to the datatrack database.

1.4 Configuring Trendable
In APPHOME/admin/config.php, update the $username, $password and $host variables to match those of your MySQL environment.

DataTrack should now be successfully deployed.


2. ADDING DATASETS
2.1 Additional datasets for yearly or monthly data may be added using our online interface. Datasets are stored to our database so that they may accessed again later.
